Responsive Portfolio made with Bootstrap

Responsive design creates web applications that render properly on all devices with different screen sizes. 
I created a mobile-first application and added some responsive design to an existing application by customizing css.

I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate a portfolio. The guidelines are as follow:

* Create 3 pages: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
* Each page should have at least the following items: navigation bar, main responsive layout and images.
* Bootstrap minimizes the use of media queries. I used the Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns) and took advantage of the built-in Bootstrap mobile first responsiveness.
* xs screens, content should take up the entire screen.
* sm and larger screens, should have margins on the left/right sides of the screen.
